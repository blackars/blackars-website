This is the sample #1 of a Reaction-Diffusion system made with node components in Touchdessigner.

Initial Seed: A noise1 operator generates a random pattern in grayscale levels.

**Feedback:** The feedback1 accumulates iterations. Each frame reinjects the previous output.
**Diffusion:** A blur1 (Gaussian) smooths the feedback buffer, modeling the passage of time for the substance.
**Reaction:** A sharpen applied after the blur emphasizes the edges (areas with strong gradients), mimicking chemical interactions.
**Thresholding / Contours:** After the reaction, a lumaBlur1 followed by a comp1 (or a simple level/ramp map) transforms the image into black-and-white "rings," resembling the typical contoured patterns of the Grayâ€“Scott model.
**Control:** Additionally, a keyboardin is connected to feedback1 to "seed" or reset the reaction with a key press.
**Result:** Maze-like textures with sharply defined black-and-white contours
