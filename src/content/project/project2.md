abstract: "Portals Garden is an innovative 3D web experience that serves as the first visual narrative gateway into the NOXISTENCE universe. Built with Three.js and enhanced with TensorFlow.js capabilities, this immersive digital garden allows users to explore interconnected portals that reveal fragments of impossible realities trapped within the plane of nonexistence. Each portal contains unique interactive experiences—from molecular DNA base sequencing and Conway's Game of Life in 3D, to encounters with alien consciousness and deep space phenomena. More than just a collection of experiences, Portals Garden functions as a transmedia bridge where philosophy meets technology, creating contemplative spaces for exploration and reflection. Its modular architecture paves the way for future expansions of the NOXISTENCE lore, where each new portal becomes a window into the ontological mysteries of beings and places that exist only because they cannot exist anywhere else."

# **Portals Garden**
<br>

_Within NOXISTENCE, there are spaces where many other places bloom and where paths to complex existences trapped in this limbo can be found. These gardens are not isolated points; it is evident that something connects them. They are paths to everything that nonexistence captures here, but they are also trails that gradually unveil the secrets hidden within._

Portals Garden 001 is the first cluster of experiences related to the narrative universe I introduced in the previous blog: **[ _"About NOXISTENCE"_](https://blackars.com/blog/post2)**. In this garden of portals, the exploration of stories behind landscapes, creatures, and many other aspects of the lore of this universe begins.  

It is a first staging and extension of my fictional universe and its transmedia narrative possibilities through the web, using JavaScript, CSS, and vanilla HTML with Three.js as the main framework, along with certain Tensorflow.js functionalities. The goal is to create experiences that are not just games but also spaces of creation and expression—corners of art to explore and reflect upon—a total of 9, which we will discover below.  
<br>

<br>

The first garden of portals shows us a glimpse of how interaction works to enter the experiences that bloom here.  
<br>

## **Clean Squared Place**
<br>

<br>

This experience is the only one that is not in 3D. It consists of clearing the Squared Place of the entities trapped in it. Upon completion, a pattern is obtained to unlock another experience:

# **Nitrogenous Bases**
<br>

Once the access code is entered, we arrive at the molecular computer of nitrogenous bases. In this drag-and-drop experience, we organize the molecules into one of the 5 patterns corresponding to each of the experiences hidden in the code of life.  
<br>

# **Game Of Life**
<br>

This experience will not take you beyond itself—or will it? John Horton Conway’s traditional Game of Life is reinterpreted in 3D with my preferred aesthetic, offering a simple space for experimentation, reflection through what is visualized, and interpretations of these simple forms that appeal to something as complex as life.  
<br>

# **AnothEarth**
<br>

This is the main portal from which all experiences and websites related to the AnothEarth universe will be woven. Currently, it only links to the corresponding lore section on the main NOXISTENCE website.  
<br>

# **Maxkodia Planet**
<br>

This experience works in a similar, if not identical, way to AnothEarth.  
<br>

<br>

# **Space Words**
<br>

In this experience, we explore a glimpse of what a gaze into space captured in NOXISTENCE has to tell us about its captor.  
<br>

<br>

# **Deep Space Encounter**
<br>

In this experience, we face one of the dangers of space—at the edge of death—to understand and confront the power of a circle…  
<br>

# **Gardhan Thinker**
<br>

![Gardhan Thinker](screenshots/portalsgarden/gardhanthinker.webp)  
<br>

Here we meet a thinker of the Gardhan species. Trapped within its thoughts, we can interact with this mind to open an experience that already begins to lead us into a dark corner of NOXISTENCE…  
<br>

# **Human Thinker**
<br>

![Human Thinker](screenshots/portalsgarden/humanthinker.webp)  
<br>

Here lies a human thinker, in a limbo of concepts, ideas, and visions of a reality difficult to grasp. What does the human mind have to reveal to us?
